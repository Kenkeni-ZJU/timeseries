README

The full-length test time series generated with different models or coming from previously published data are in timeseries.zip, versions of these time series with Poisson noise are in noisyTimeSeries.zip.

Most time series are raw, i.e. as generated by the models without further processing steps. For the stool time series, data were processed by rarefaction to 10000 reads per sample and interpolated with method "stineman" in the stinepack R package.   

To generate the noisy time series, values were sampled from a Poisson distribution that took the original value as a parameter. Prior to Poisson sampling, time series were scaled to a minimum of 1000 counts per sample.  

Time series are stored as tab-delimited tables where rows represent species and columns time points.
