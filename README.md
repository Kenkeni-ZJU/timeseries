The full-length test time series generated with different models are in timeseries.zip, whereas slicedTimeseries.zip contains sub-sets of the full-length time series. The sub-set definitions are given in the sliceDefinitions.txt file, which is included in slicedTimeseries.zip.
Time series are raw, i.e. as generated by the models without normalization. They are stored as tab-delimited tables where rows represent species and columns time points.
