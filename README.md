README

The full-length test time series generated with different models are in timeseries.zip, whereas slicedTimeseries.zip contains sub-sets of the full-length time series. The sub-set definitions are given in the sliceDefinitions.txt file, which is included in slicedTimeseries.zip.
Most time series are raw, i.e. as generated by the models without normalization. For the stool time series, data were normalized by rarefaction to 10000 reads per sample and interpolated with method "stineman" in the stinepack R package. 
Time series are stored as tab-delimited tables where rows represent species and columns time points.
